# RedGifs Viewer

An alternative frontend for browsing RedGifs content with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities. Built with FastAPI and vanilla JavaScript, this web application provides a clean, responsive interface for viewing user gifs with the ability to sort by views, likes, and duration.

## Features

- **User Profile Browsing**: Search for any RedGifs user and view their profile information
- **Advanced Sorting**:
  - API-level sorting: Latest, Trending, Top (All Time), Top Week, Top Month
  - Client-side sorting: Most/Least Views, Most/Least Likes, Longest/Shortest, Newest/Oldest
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Video Player**: Full-screen modal video player with metadata display
- **Pagination**: Load more results as you browse
- **Statistics**: View counts, likes, duration, and audio indicators for each gif
- **Clean UI**: Modern dark theme with smooth animations

## Screenshots

The interface includes:
- Search bar for finding users
- User profile cards with stats (gifs, views, followers)
- Grid layout of thumbnails with overlays showing views/likes
- Modal video player with tags and download options
- Dual sorting system (API + client-side)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Or using uvicorn directly:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Search for a user** by entering their username in the search bar

4. **Sort results** using the dropdown menus:
   - **API Sort**: Changes what data is fetched from RedGifs (requires reload)
   - **Client Sort**: Re-sorts already loaded data instantly

5. **Click on any gif** to open it in the full-screen video player

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following REST API endpoints:

### `GET /api/user/{username}`
Get user profile information
- **Response**: User object with stats and profile details

### `GET /api/user/{username}/gifs`
Get gifs from a specific user
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `page` (default: 1): Page number
  - `count` (default: 80, max: 150): Results per page
  - `order` (default: latest): trending, latest, top, top7, top28
- **Response**: Paginated list of gifs with creator info

### `GET /api/search`
Search for gifs by keyword/tag
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `q` (required): Search query
  - `page`, `count`, `order`: Same as above
- **Response**: Search results with matching gifs

### `GET /api/trending`
Get current trending gifs
- **Response**: List of top 10 trending gifs

## How It Works

1. **Backend (main.py)**:
   - FastAPI server that wraps the `redgifs` Python library
   - Authenticates with RedGifs API using temporary tokens
   - Provides RESTful endpoints for the frontend
   - Converts Python objects to JSON responses

2. **Frontend (index.html)**:
   - Vanilla JavaScript SPA (no framework needed)
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
   - Fetches data from backend API
   - Implements dual sorting system:
     - API sorting fetches differently ordered data
     - Client sorting reorganizes loaded data without refetching

## Sorting Explained

### API Sort (Server-side)
Determines which gifs are fetched from RedGifs:
- **Latest**: Most recently uploaded
- **Trending**: Currently popular
- **Top**: Highest rated all-time
- **Top Week**: Best from last 7 days
- **Top Month**: Best from last 28 days

### Client Sort (Browser-side)
Re-organizes already loaded gifs without refetching:
- **Default**: Maintains API sort order
- **Views**: Sort by view count (high/low)
- **Likes**: Sort by like count (high/low)
- **Duration**: Sort by video length (long/short)
- **Date**: Sort by upload date (new/old)

This dual system allows you to fetch "Top All Time" from the API, then re-sort those results by views or duration without making new requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI - Modern Python web framework
  - Uvicorn - ASGI server
  - redgifs - Python wrapper for RedGifs API

- **Frontend**:
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework
  - HTML5 Video API

## Notes

- The application requires internet access to fetch data from RedGifs
- Videos are streamed directly from RedGifs CDN
- Authentication is handled automatically via temporary tokens
- No user data is stored or tracked by this application

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Module not found" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you've installed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Can't find user
- **Solution**: Verify the username is correct and the user exists on RedGifs

**Issue**: Videos not loading
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure RedGifs is accessible

**Issue**: Port 8000 already in use
- **Solution**: Change the port by running: `uvicorn main:app --port 8001`
